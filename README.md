# APA-6-Reference-Generator
This project contains HTML code for generating APA 6 references from a given URL.

## HTML Code

### Description
The HTML file `index.html` contains a simple web page that allows users to input a URL and generate an APA 6 reference for the webpage. It uses JavaScript to fetch the webpage content, extract the necessary details (title, publication date, site name), and generate the reference.

### How to Use
1. Ensure you have an internet connection.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter the URL of the webpage for which you want to generate an APA 6 reference in the input field.
4. Click the "Generate Reference" button.
5. The generated APA 6 reference will be displayed below the button.

### Example Output

If the provided URL is `https://example.com`, and the webpage has the title "Example Domain", no publication date, and site name "Example", the generated APA 6 reference would be:

Example. (n.d.). Example Domain. Retrieved from https://example.com
